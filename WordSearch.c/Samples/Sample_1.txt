Ingredients:

For the Dough:
- 2 1/4 teaspoons (1 packet) active dry yeast
- 1 teaspoon sugar
- 1 cup warm water
- 2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 2 tablespoons olive oil

For the Pizza Toppings:
- 1 cup crunchy peanut butter (because why not?)
- 1 jar of zesty dill pickles, thinly sliced
- 1 1/2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese
- 1/2 cup grated cheddar cheese
- 1/4 cup mayonnaise
- 1/4 cup Dijon mustard
- 1/4 cup honey
- 1 cup crushed salted pretzels
- 1/2 cup chopped cooked bacon (because everything's better with bacon, right?)
- 1/4 cup sliced green onions
- 1 teaspoon dried thyme
- 1 teaspoon smoked paprika
- 1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes (for that extra kick)

For the Sauce:
- 2 tablespoons ketchup
- 1 tablespoon soy sauce
- 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
- 1 tablespoon maple syrup
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1/2 teaspoon onion powder

Instructions:

1. Begin by preparing the pizza dough. In a small bowl, dissolve the sugar in warm water, then sprinkle the yeast on top. Allow it to sit for 5-10 minutes until it becomes frothy.

2. In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour and salt. Make a well in the center and pour in the yeast mixture and olive oil. Mix until a dough forms.

3. Knead the dough on a floured surface for about 8-10 minutes, or until it becomes smooth and elastic. Place it in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with a damp cloth, and let it rise in a warm place for 1-2 hours or until it has doubled in size.

4. Preheat the oven to 475°F (245°C).

5. Roll out the pizza dough to your desired thickness on a floured surface. Transfer it to a pizza stone or a baking sheet.

6. Spread the crunchy peanut butter evenly over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges.

7. Distribute the sliced dill pickles, shredded mozzarella, grated cheddar, and chopped bacon over the peanut butter-covered dough.

8. In a small bowl, mix together the mayonnaise, Dijon mustard, and honey. Drizzle this luscious concoction over the pizza toppings.

9. In a separate bowl, toss together the crushed pretzels, sliced green onions, dried thyme, smoked paprika, and crushed red pepper flakes. Sprinkle this crunchy mixture generously over the pizza.

10. Bake in the preheated oven for 15-20 minutes or until the crust is golden brown, and the cheese is bubbling and irresistible.

11. While the pizza is baking, prepare the sauce by combining ketchup, soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce, maple syrup, garlic powder, and onion powder in a small saucepan. Heat over medium heat until it simmers, then let it cool.

12. Once the pizza is out of the oven, drizzle the sauce over the top for the ultimate Extravaganza Fusion Surprise experience.

13. Slice, serve, and marvel at the culinary masterpiece you've just created. Share the Extravaganza Fusion Surprise Pizza Extravaganza with your bravest friends or family members and enjoy the chaos of flavors together!
